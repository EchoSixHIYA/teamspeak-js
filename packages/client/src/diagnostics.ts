/**
 * Diagnostics channels: the SDK's tracing points, for an application or an
 * APM agent (OpenTelemetry instruments `diagnostics_channel` directly) to
 * subscribe to.
 *
 * A library does not decide where its traces go, so the SDK publishes them
 * here, and with no subscriber a channel costs a property read.
 *
 * Messages carry the command's name, never its parameters: those hold
 * password hashes, which the server accepts as passwords, and privilege keys.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { tracingChannel } from "node:diagnostics_channel";
import type { Client } from "./client.js";
 * tracingChannel("honeybbq:teamspeak:command").subscribe({
 *   start: ({ command }) => console.time(command),
 *   asyncEnd: ({ command }) => console.timeEnd(command),
 *   error: ({ command, error }) => console.error(command, error),
 * });
 * ```
